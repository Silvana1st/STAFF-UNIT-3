# Wellcome to week 4

This week you will work through two notebooks, SPRINT_1_introduction_a and SPRINT_1_introduction_b

In notebook a, you will learn how to recover and make-sense-of RefSeq data using the biopython Python package
In notebook b, we will introduce the JSON data format and learn about REST APIs by:
    - reading an introduction to the REST API framework
    - Creating a simple REST API of our own
    - Requesting and making-sense-of date from our own simple API
    
### Assignment

This week we have set an assignment in two parts.

The objective of the assignment is to teach you how to create a user-friendly tool that may be of use to you, or your
colleagues in the future. 

By completing the assignments (which will be expanded throughout the remainder of this module) you will also contribute
to the development of a bioinformatics API which is being used world-wide; as both a developer and an end-user
