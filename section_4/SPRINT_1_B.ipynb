    "\n",
    "- JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "- JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data\n",
    "- JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page\n",
    "- JSON is \"self-describing\" and easy to understand\n",
    "- JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data\n",
    "- JSON is \"self-describing\" and easy to understand\n",
    "- JSON is language independent\\*\n",
    "\n",
    "\\**JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Text can be read and used as a data format by any programming language, and is also human-readable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is very easy to [learn](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) and is easy to write using Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exchanging Data\n",
    "JSON was concieved as a data-exchange format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When exchanging data between a web-browser and a server, the data can be text-only.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can convert the core Python objects into JSON, *i.e.* strings, lists and dictionaries \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript, or other programming language objects (*e.g.* Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations, unlike the XML format which is much more complicated to process. **We will look at the XML format in a later tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending Data\n",
    "If you have data stored in a JavaScript or Python object, you can convert the object into JSON, and send it to a server: \n",
    "- [JSON example 1](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/tryit.asp?filename=trywhatis_json_parse)\n",
    "- Change the element numbers in the example to create the name **John Jones**\n",
    "- [JSON example 2](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjson_send)\n",
    "- Change the function so that it tells us that **John Jones from Skegness is 47**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Data\n",
    "Because JSON is [serializable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) text it is an excellent format for storing structured data. In the assignment for SPRINT_1_introduction_a you stored a JSON in a flat text-file. JSON can also be stored in popular databases such as [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It is also highly compatable with the popular [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) database [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)"

    "\n",
    "The JSON you were working with in \"Reading and Writing JSON using Python, Exercise 1\" was generated using the [VariantValidator REST API](https://rest.variantvalidator.org), which I maintain. The current API has become out-dated and clunky. Worst of all, it relies on Python libraries that are no longer maintained. For a while I maintained my own version of these libraries, but now that Python 2 is being obsoleted, they are no-longer fit-for-purpose. Consequently, I need to replace the VariantValidator API with an up-to-date interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "VariantValidator has form its inception been made as user-friendly as possible, so it is essential that the API is simple to use for experts and novice users alike. I also want to improve the API so that it will return a range of  responses rather than just JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many API tutorials are overly complicated for the purposes of this module because they attempt to condense the broad range of API capabilities rather than focussing on creating a simple APi and getting it working. The VariantValdator interface is very simple. The tool only returns data from GET requests and does not require any form of user log in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The VariantValidator REST API uses the VariantValidator Python library to create the data that it returns. In this tutorial, rather than installing the Python library, we will request our data from the VariantValidator rest API. This may seem a little \"off-the-wall\" but it will begin to make sense when your assignments in SPRINT_2 are set! For the purposes of this tutorial, this allows me to demonstrate both building a simple API, how we request data from APIs and explain the structure of the data that are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are decorators?\n",
    "When you look at the code which comprises our REST API, you will see functions that require decoration. These functions look like this\n",

    "@hello_space.route(\"/\")\n",
    "class HelloClass(Resource):\n",

    "We are not going to look at decorators in detail during these tutorials because they can be very complex! However a tutorial on decorators can be found [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/decorators-python) and it is well worth reading through the tutorial if you have the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, all we need to know about decorators is that they allow us to create a function that gathers data, (in this instance, captures the user's request and compiles the text we want to display to the user (including relevant metadata), and the function is passed to the decorator function which makes use of the gathered data. \n",

As users as well as programmers, you will have useful ideas about the development of the tool which may not have occurred to me.
