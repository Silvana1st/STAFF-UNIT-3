Your task this week is to create a functional API endpoint that addresses a user need based on the user-stories from 
week_2. 

It is entirely up to you how complicated the task you choose is. The minimum requirement we have is that you produce a 
functional API endpoint which is written in PEP-8 compliant Python with at least enough documentation such that we can 
run the API and test that your code works as you had intended.

Additional criteria and the marking rubric can be found [here](lnk)

Remember, you still need to apply what you have learned during this unit.

1. Open an issue on GitHub to outline the task you have assigned yourself and invite your team to comment.
2. Create your own branch for your own coding assignment
3. You can also open a discussion on Slack so your team can discuss (Also, if you can, get involved with your team 
mates discussions)
4. Make sure you log you working in git issues
5. If you need help, push your branch to GitHub so your team members can review the code and if necessary, checkout your 
branch and make changes for you (This is allowed and will not be penalised, so long as we can trace the activity on git.
 Use Git Issues)
6. If you find help externally, *e.g.* Stack Overflow, Make sure you provide a link
7. When you have finished your coding, push your branch to GitHub and close any open issues relating to your project
8. ***Do not submit a pull-request, to make our lives easier, we want to keep your work on separate branches. Thanks***

***Note: The facilitators will comment on Git Issues. If you have any issues or want some additional input please 
contact Pete Causey-Freeman via git. Remember this is a real-world development environment. It may not be possible to 
respond straight away, but you will recieve a response.***

You will create a short (10 min) presentation summarising your reflection on the above programming. In the presentation 
you should:

-	Introduce yourself
-	Introduce your user story and why you chose it
-	Describe what your coding project set out to do and what was achieved
-	Describe the steps you took to ensure your coding was high quality, usable and sharable
-	Reflect on how you might improve your code
-	Provide insights as to how you used GitHub or Slack to support your studies to help you achieve the coding and throughout this unit  
-	Produce a reference slide (in Harvard or Vancouver Style) which include any websites, tutorials and any other resources you used
